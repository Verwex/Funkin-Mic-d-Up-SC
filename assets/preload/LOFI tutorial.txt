How to make Lo-fi edits of regular music in audacity:

1. Take the normal songs
2. Lower their pitch by exactly 15.910, 3 semitones. Make sure to use high quality stretching if you're on Audacity.
3. Speed them down by 20%.
4. Apply reverb:
100% room size, 10ms of pre-delay, 50% reverberance and damping, 100% tone low and tome high, 4 wet and dry gain, and 100% stereo width. Also on Audacity.
5. Amplify by what Audacity suggests you if it's by a negative amount. It is acceptable to amplify it by a positive amount if it's not too big of a change.
6. Export.


7. Enjoy some lo-fi music! Sure, it might take a long time to do, especially if you are on a low-end PC but it produces the best results. Best to wait rather than rush.

P.S. Doing step 2 and 3 in reverse can work, but it will generally take longer.
